Hi, my name is Stefan Neumann and I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at),
generously funded by a [WWTF VRG grant](/vrg). My main research areas are as follows:
* **Foundations of data science:** I develop *practical data science
  algorithms with provable guarantees*. I am particularly interested in
  the beyond worst-case analysis of algorithms.
* **Social network analysis:** I study how interventions, such as timeline
  algorithms, influence the polarization and the disagreement in (online) social
  networks.

Previously, I was a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org) assistant professor at 
[KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se)
and a post-doc in the group of [Aris Gionis](https://www.kth.se/profile/argioni).
I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at),
advised by [Monika Henzinger](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/henzinger_monika-group/).
During that time, I visited [Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/) at
[Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) for six months.

My Ph.D. thesis won the [Heinz Zemanek Award](https://www.ocg.at/hzp) from the
[Austrian Computer Society](https://www.ocg.at/en) and an
[Award of Excellence](https://www.bmbwf.gv.at/Ministerium/staatspreise-auszeichnungen/Staatspreise.html)
from the Austrian federal government.

You can find more information including all of my publications in my
[**CV**]({{site.baseurl}}/files/CV_stefan.pdf).
