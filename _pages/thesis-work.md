I supervise many theses and work on multiple projects, so to stay organized, I
ask you to follow these guidelines.  These steps ensure that our meetings are
productive and that we track progress effectively.

- **Start of each meeting:** Begin with a 2-3 minute recap of what we discussed
last time.
- **During the meeting:** Focus on asking me the questions you may have. In
particular, focus on discussing what is unclear to you and where you might not
know what to do next. The summary of what you have done since the last meeting
should be relatively short (you do not have to impress me with how many things
you have done, I trust that you are working hard).
- **Meeting length:** Meetings should be about 30 minutes. This is not a hard
limit, but in my experience it is enough to discuss the most important topics.
- **Meeting summary:** Within 24 hours after each meeting, send me an email
containing:
	- Three bullet points summarizing what we discussed.
	- Three bullet points outlining the next steps until our next meeting.
	- This does not have to be polished and should be concise.
- **Version control:** Once you start working, create a git repository where I
can access your writing and code and share it with me.
