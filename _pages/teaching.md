## Current Teaching: Summer 2025

- **[Algorithms for Data Science](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=4007&dsrid=677&semester=2025S&courseNr=194176)**<br>
A Master's course on fundamental algorithms for analyzing large amounts of data.
It is based on important results of the algorithms community which are widely
recognized for their practical applications in data science. The course will
cover algorithms for questions, such as: How can one find duplicate pages on the
web? How can one detect communities in social networks? How can we embed
high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces, to analyze data more
efficiently?

Every semester I am also engaged in the Bachelor seminar **[Scientific Research and Writing](https://ml-tuw.github.io/teaching/)**.  I am supervising the topics on *Beyond Worst-Case Analysis* and *The Theory of Opinion Formation in Social Networks*.

**Thesis supervision:** If you are interested in writing your BSc or MSc thesis
with me, please first read the [instructions on how to work with me on a
thesis](/thesis-work). If those work for you, please check the topics I uploaded
on TISS and contact me by email.
